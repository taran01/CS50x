sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: I've averaged the running time of each and every txt file for every sort method.
                  Sort1's difference in running time was huge between sorted and random.
                  We know big O of bubble sort is O(n2) and big Omega is (n).
                  So that's why I chose sort1 to be bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Time difference between sort2 and sort3 was significant and sort2 was way better. So that's merge sort.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Well only sort3 left so that'll be Selection sort.
